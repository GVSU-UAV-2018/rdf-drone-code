# A note about sample rates:
# There is an inherent tradeoff between frequency resolution and time resolution.
# This is independent of the input sample rate, and depends only on the output sample rate.
# For an input sample rate of 600 kHz, and FFT with 512 bins, the output sample rate
# is about 1172 Hz. This gives a frequency resolution of 1172 Hz, and a time resolution
# <1 ms.
